     <p>There's been a lot of confusion about the PHPNG branch and third-party sites have spread a lot of misinformation. So we thought we'd take a break from looking at kittens on the Internet and provide some more information.</p>
     <p>Over the last year some developers were researching the possibility of introducing JIT compilation capabilities to PHP. During this research, they realized that in order to achieve optimal performance from PHP some internal API's should be changed. This gave birth to the phpng branch, initially authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui, and Nikita Popov. This branch improves memory usage and cleans up some core API's; it does not include JIT compiliation.</p>
     <p>The optimistically named PHP Next Generation branch provides a considerable performance improvement in real world applications; for example, Wordpress has a 20% increased throughput on this branch. There is still a lot of work to be done to make this patch production ready and it hasn't yet been voted on yet. The patch authors are hoping that it will be a suitable base for PHP 6.0.</p>
